## Tips for Using CLAUDE.local.md

1. **Keep it updated**: Revise as your preferences change
2. **Be specific**: The more detail, the better Claude can assist
3. **Include context**: Current projects help Claude provide relevant help
4. **Note constraints**: Budget, device limitations, skill level, etc.
5. **Add examples**: Show Claude examples of your preferred patterns

## Privacy Note

This file is **never committed** to git (it's in `.gitignore`), so you can:
- Include specific entity names from your HA instance
- Note security-sensitive automations
- Add personal development notes
- Reference local file paths specific to your machine

However, still **avoid** including:
- Passwords or API tokens (use `.env` for those)
- Personal identifying information you wouldn't want in backups
- Sensitive details about your physical security setup
